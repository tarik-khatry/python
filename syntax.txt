The modulo operation a % b gives the remainder when a is divided by b.

try:
except: zeroDivisionError:  written to address errors in a programme

finally:  block executes even with errors 

raise Exception()  to raise a red error of our own

DataFrame is nothing but two dimentional tabular form to store datasets

#pandas 
scores = pd.read_csv('scores.csv')
print(scores['Name']) Reads all the data columnwise
print(scores[scores['name'] == 'nishant' ])  --> reads all the data rowise
scores.head()   prints first 5 rows from dataset 
scores.tail()   prints Last 5 rows from dataset 

print("somthing", end=" ", sep="-")      
      end makes it on one line, sep is seperator  
      
print(f'{num} x {i} = {num*i}')  
    f' stands for formated printing
    
print('{0} x {1} = {2}'.format(num,i,num*i))
    format function printing
    
print('%d x %d = %d'.%(num,i,num*i))
  print using modulo function - old way used in c

print(f'{num} x {i} = {num*i:.2f} ')     :.2f  gives answer to 2 decimal places
print('{0:5d}'.format(1))      :5d specifies that we need 5 charecters
        d is for integers and f is for float (:5f)


SET is used for big data set. can search fast. but cant represent element like s[0]
LIST is for small data set. searches slow. can be changed.  flexiblity 
TUPLE is unchangable. less size. element can be changed when in list which is in tuple


    FUNCTIONS

LAMBA
super short function and can be written in one line
ENUMERATE
gives us index and value at the index in lists etc
ZIP 
combines two lists in pythons and sticks first value of one list with other print(zip(fruits,size)) fruits and size are two lists

MAP(FUNCTION,ARGUEMENT1(list),ARGUEMENT2)
FILTER(FUNCTION,ARGUEMENT1(list),ARGUEMENT2)
